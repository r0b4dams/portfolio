            Following a successful start to a career specializing in the repair and modification of
            avionics equipment, the shifting nature of the industry led me to realize that I needed
            to make a change in order to find a more challenging, dynamic, and fulfilling
            opportunity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Immersing myself in programming has really solidified my appreciation for what I find
            rewarding: learning new things, problem solving, and helping build something tangible.
            I’m eager and excited to contribute my skills to a collaborative environment and I look
            forward to learning more!
          </p>
